# Fire-Emblem-
A C++ Fire Emblem engine

Work in progress... ^_^"

This engine tries for 2 things:
1 A small executable size (max 4 MB for a full game made with it, excluding images and sound)
2 To be similar to the GBA Fire Emblem engine. (This engine is modelled off the GBA engine)

It (will) use OpenGL, SDL and stb_image.c.
